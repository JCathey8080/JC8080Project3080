## About the Collection
### Rain or Shine is a collection about the worst storm in Florida's history and its impact

**On September 10th, 1960** one of the worst hurricanes would make landfall in Florida. The impact was destructive enough for the National Hurricane Center to retire the name. Hurricane Donna has earned its place in history for its staggering amount of property damage, in the US alone Donna caused $387 million in damage. While most reporting and retrospectives about Donna focus on the financial impact of storm damage, the effects of hurricane Donna are far greater and wide-reaching than just property damage. The ways that Floridians were impacted by hurricane Donna were varied and unique. 

In his book Hurricanes, Their Nature and Impacts on Society, Roger Pielke states “What is the value of a lost beach, park, or unrecoverable time in school, etc.? What are the costs associated with psychological trauma?” In the book he states the quantitative values of hurricanes are not the only way to measure the impacts of hurricanes. The emotional impact of hurricanes can be long-lasting and affect individuals as well as communities. 

In a series of oral history interviews published by the Charlotte County Library, Joe Guerzo interviewed 3 residents who lived in Florida during hurricane Donna. In an interview with Buddy Alexander, he says the following about Donna “The wind, it was strong, but it wasn’t that strong. It wasn’t anything like Charley. I don’t ever want to go through something like that again.” But, along with the fearful stories from Donna there are also stories about community. In Guerzo’s interview with Bill Massolio, Massolio describes how he and his family left their home afraid their roof would collapse, but fortunately their neighbor had them stay in his home. They later evacuated together through the flooding. These interviews highlight the emotional impact that disastrous hurricanes can have. It also shows how long these impacts can stay with people, all of these interviewees were in their 60s and still remember how they felt at the time.
